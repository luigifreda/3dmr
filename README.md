# 3DMR 


**3D Multi-Robot** Exploration, Patrolling and Navigation.

**Maintainer: [Luigi Freda](https://www.luigifreda.com)**


The 3DMR framework provides tools for 3D multi-robot *exploration*, *patrolling* and *navigation* tasks with different *robots* under different *simulators*. It provides the core *C++* implementation behind our papers:

This repository allows testing our proposed multi-robot strategies within [V-REP](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) and [gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/home). It extends and improves our previous framework **[3dpatrolling](https://github.com/luigifreda/3dpatrolling)**. [Here](./new_features.md), you can find a list of new features we added.

**Simulators**: [V-REP](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) and [gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/home).  

**GUIs**: our [PyQt GUIs](#guis) offer a convenient entry point for quickly launching exploration, patrolling and navigation systems.

----
## Prerequisites

3DMR requires **ROS noetic** under Ubuntu **20.04**. Python3 is required in order to start our **PyQt** GUIs. If you do not have this Ubuntu version, you can use [rosdocker](https://github.com/luigifreda/rosdocker#3dmr). 

## Quick install and build

Here, you can find a quick install procedure (tested under **Ubuntu 20.04**). Open a new terminal and get into the root folder of this repo. Run the following commands: 
* automagically install V-REP, gazebo, ROS dependencies and everything else is required:     
`./install.sh`    
* build all the workspaces in this repo:     
`./build_all.sh`    
* source all the 3DMR workspaces:        
`source source_all.bash`    
Now, you're ready to test our *exploration*, *patrolling* and *navigation* systems. See the next sections for further details.  

If you do not have Ubuntu 20.04, you can use [rosdocker](https://github.com/luigifreda/rosdocker#3dmr).

Refer to [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) if you need a manual installation.

## Repo organization

### Workspaces

3DMR is a stack of ROS packages organized in different *workspace folders* (with suffix `_ws`): 
* `mapping_ws` collects volumetric mapping tools integrated in our system (octomap, [voxblox](https://github.com/ethz-asl/voxblox), robot-centric [elavation mapping](https://github.com/ANYbotics/elevation_mapping)).
* `nav_ws` collects the packages that allow path planning, trajectory control, navigation, and V-REP simulation with the tracked robots.
* `patrolling_ws` collects our main patrolling packages imported from [3dpatrolling](https://github.com/luigifreda/3dpatrolling).   
* `exploration_ws` collects packages used for multi-robot exploration and a porting of the [nbvplanner](https://github.com/ethz-asl/nbvplanner) packages (exploration for drones) to ROS noetic.  
* `jackal_ws` collects gazebo packages and launch files for multi-robot navigation and exploration with a team of jackal robots equipped with LIDAR. 
* `pioneer_ws` collects packages used for multi-robot navigation and exploration with a team of pioneer robots equipped with RGBD cameras. 
* `teb_ws` collects the [TEB](https://github.com/rst-tu-dortmund/teb_local_planner) tools that we integrated into our system. 

In each workspace, you can use the script`compile_with_catkin_build.sh` to separately build the workspace with `catkin build`.  

###  Main scripts

Open a new terminal and from the root folder of this repo you can:
- build all the workspaces    
`./build_all.sh `
- source the workspaces by using the command   
`source source_all.bash`     
Once you have sourced the workspaces, you're ready to test the *patrolling* and *exploration* systems, or the *path planner* (see the next sections).
- if needed, clean the workspaces by running   
`./clean_all.sh `

See the *[GUIs](#guis)* section below on how to use our `main_*.py` **GUI scripts**.

----
## GUIs 

We have different **PyQt GUIs** for launching exploration, patrolling and path planner systems on the different robot systems. You can run: 

* `$ ./main.py` for TRADR UGVs equipped with rotating laser-scanners
* `$ ./main_pioneer.py` for pioneer robots equipped with RGBD cameras
* `$ ./main_jackal.py` for jackal UGVs equipped with LIDARs, IMUs and cameras
* `$ ./main_uav.py` for a team of UAVs equipped with stereo/depth cameras and IMUs ([nbvplanner](https://github.com/ethz-asl/nbvplanner))

The buttons and tooltips should be self-explanatory. Start playing with them and refer to the following README files for further details:

## SLAM integration

On the TRADR tracked robots, we initially used the LIDAR SLAM frameworks [laser-slam](https://github.com/ethz-asl/laser_slam) and [segmap](https://github.com/ethz-asl/segmap). On the pioneer 3-DX robots with RGBD cameras, we used [RTAB-Map](http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap).

If you have robots with 3D LIDARs, you may want to take a look at this cool paper for alternative SLAM tools: *[Present and Future of SLAM in Extreme Underground Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01787)*

## Credits 

* Some of the packages in the folders `nav_ws/src/robot` and `nav_ws/src/msgs`have been developed by the [TRADR team](https://www.luigifreda.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG-20180321-WA0009-1024x768.jpg). Thanks to all the guys who shared with us cold tents, hot coffee and wonderful life moments during TRADR demos, integrations, exercises and reviews!

* We implemented our patrolling agent in the ROS package `patrolling3d_sim`. We used the package [patrolling_sim](http://wiki.ros.org/patrolling_sim) as a starting point (further details in our [3D patrolling paper](http://www.luigifreda.com/pubs/Freda%20-%203D%20Multi-Robot%20Patrolling%20with%20a%20Two-Level%20Coordination%20Strategy%20-%20AURO%202018%20-%20pub.pdf)). We would like to thank the Authors for their great work. 

* Our exploration agent is implemented in the ROS package `expl_planner`. The package [nbvplanner](https://github.com/ethz-asl/nbvplanner) was used as a starting point (further details in our [3D exploration paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.02417.pdf)). We sincerely express our gratitude to the Authors for their great work.

* The jackal workspace contains tools from https://github.com/jackal/jackal. Many thanks to the Authors of that repository.
